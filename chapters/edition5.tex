\section*{Foreword of the fifth edition}

I want to thank Philip Kime for help with biber, the tool that Language Science Press is using for
creating lists of referecnes and for manipulating bibliography databases.

% added Ajdukiewicz35a-u to DP authors.

% changed some examples in 1-begriffe and other files

% 23.02.2021 changed AdvP -> [very] to AdvP -> [very,roof]

% 23.02.2021 fn regarding triangles in trees

% 26.01.2021 added Lötscher85 to dg chapter.

I fixed a mistake at the beginning of Section~\ref{sec-typeraising}: it now reads backward
application instead of forward application.

I fixed the Case Principle in the chapter on HPSG. The first two clauses did not mention that they
only apply to verbal heads.

I fixed some brackets in the Categorial Grammar derivation in Figure~\ref{Abbildung-CG-isst-der-junge-den-kuchen-jacobs}. There were
just too many brackets to keep track of everything \ldots. Thanks to Matthew Korte for spotting this!
Léonie Cujé found superflous brackets in Figure~\ref{abb-CG-Adjunktion}. They were removed. Thanks!
