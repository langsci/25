\section*{Language Science Press: scholar-owned high quality linguistic books}

In 2012 a group of people found the situation in the publishing business so unbearable that they
agreed that it would be worthwhile to start a bigger initiative for publishing linguistics books in
platinum open access, that is, free for both readers and authors. I set up a web page and collected
supporters, very prominent linguists from all over the world and all subdisciplines and Martin
Haspelmath and I then founded Language Science Press. At about the same time the DFG had announced
a program for open access monographs and we applied \citep{MH2013a} and got funded (two out of 18 applications got
funding). The money is used for a coordinator (Dr.\ Sebastian Nordhoff) and an economist (Debora
Siller), two programmers (Carola Fanselow and Dr.\ Mathias Schenner), who work on the publishing
plattform Open Monograph Press (OMP) and on conversion software that produces various formats (ePub, XML,
HTML) from our \LaTeX{} code. Svantje Lilienthal works on the documentation of OMP, produces
screencasts and does user support for authors, readers and series editors.

OMP is extended by open review facilities and community-building gamification tools
\citep{MuellerOA,MH2013a}. All Language Science Press books are reviewed by at least two external
reviewers. Reviewers and authors may agree to publish these reviews and thereby make the whole
process more transparent (see also \citew{Pullum84a} for the suggestion of open reviewing of journal
articles). In addition there is an optional second review phase: the open
review. This review is completely open to everybody. The whole community may comment on the document
that is published by Language Science Press. After this second review phase, which usually lasts for
two months, authors may revise their publication and an improved version will be published. This
book was the first book to go through this open review phase. The annotated open review version of this book is still available via
the \href{\lsURL}{web page of this book}.

Currently, Language Science Press has 17 series on various subfields of linguistics with high
profile series editors from all continents. We have 18 published and 17 forthcoming books and 146
expressions of interest. Series editors  and authors are responsible for
delivering manuscripts that are typeset in \LaTeX{}, but they are supported by a web-based typesetting
infrastructure that was set up by Language Science Press and by volunteer typesetters from the
community. Proofreading is also community-based. Until now 53 people helped improving our
books. Their work is documented in the Hall of Fame: \url{http://langsci-press.org/hallOfFame}.

If you think that textbooks like this one should be freely available to whoever wants to read them
and that publishing scientific results should not be left to profit-oriented publishers, then you
can join the Language Science Press community and support us in various ways: you can register with Language Science Press and have your name
listed on our supporter page with almost 600 other enthusiasts, you may devote your time and help
with proofreading and/or typesetting, or you may donate money for specific books or for Language
Science Press in general. We are also looking for institutional supporters like foundations,
societies, linguistics departments or university libraries. Detailed information on how to support
us is provided at the following webpage: \url{http://langsci-press.org/supportUs}.
