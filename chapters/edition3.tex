I thank Frank Van Eynde for pointing out eight typos in his review of the first edition. They have
been fixed. He also pointed out a mistake with the placement of \argst in the feature geometry of
signs in HPSG, which was due to a citation of a draft of \citew{GSag200a} from 1998. The respective
section was integrated into the main part of the chapter on HPSG in the second edition, but the
mistake carried over. It is now fixed in the third edition.
