I fixed several typos, added and updated URLs and DOIs in the book and in the list of references.
I added a footnote to Chapter~\ref{chap-GB} concerning the assignment of semantic roles
across phrase boundaries (footnote~\ref{fn-semantic-role-phrase-boundary} on
p.\,\pageref{fn-semantic-role-phrase-boundary}). I thank Andreas Pankau for discussion on this point.

I added a paragraph discussing John Torr's implementational work (pages~\pageref{page-torr-implementation-beginning}--\pageref{page-torr-implementation-end}). I thank Shalom Lappin and Richard Sproat for discussion of implementation issues.

Language Science Press will publish a handbook on Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar hopefully
later this year \citep{HPSGHandbook}. It contains several chapters comparing other syntactic
theories to HPSG. I added the respective references to the further readings sections of the chapters
for Lexical Functional Grammar, Categorial Grammar, Construction Grammar, and Minimalism.
